# Fixora – Flutter & Firebase Basics

A starter Flutter app that shows a simple welcome screen for Fixora, an urban grievance redressal concept. The goal is to practice Flutter/Dart basics, app structure, and stateful UI updates.

## Project Structure

```
lib/
	main.dart          # App entry point with the welcome screen and simple state toggle
	screens/           # Future: individual pages (dashboard, complaints, profile)
	widgets/           # Future: reusable UI components like buttons/cards
	models/            # Future: data shapes (user, complaint) for type safety
	services/          # Future: API/Firebase integration (auth, Firestore, storage)
android/ios/web/...  # Platform-specific shells generated by Flutter
```

**Why this helps modularity:** splitting UI (screens/widgets), data (models), and logic (services) keeps features isolated, makes testing simpler, and avoids large files as the app grows.

**Naming conventions:**

- Files: `snake_case.dart` (e.g., `complaint_card.dart`, `auth_service.dart`).
- Classes/Widgets: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ComplaintCard`, `AuthService`).
- Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `complaintStatus`, `isLoading`).

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Flutter SDK and Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter/Dart extensions.
2. Verify tooling: `flutter doctor`
3. (Reference) Create a new project: `flutter create your_project_name`
4. Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
5. Run on emulator/device: `flutter run`

## What I Learned

- Building UIs from widgets with `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `Column`, and `ElevatedButton`.
- Managing simple state with `StatefulWidget` and `setState` to toggle text/icon colors.
- How a clear folder plan (screens/widgets/models/services) keeps features modular as the app scales.
- Dart conventions (null safety, type-safe widgets) make refactors predictable.
