**Fixora – Smart Urban Grievance Redressal System**

Fixora is a centralized, transparent, and real-time grievance redressal system designed to help Urban Local Bodies efficiently address citizen complaints. Built using Flutter for cross-platform accessibility and Firebase for seamless backend operations, Fixora enables users to easily submit issues while allowing authorities to track, manage, and resolve them with complete accountability.

## Flutter & Dart Basics (Concept 1)

# 1. StatelessWidget vs StatefulWidget

StatelessWidget:

Does not change once it is built.

Used for static UI like text, icons, simple layouts.

StatefulWidget:

Can change during the app’s lifetime.

Used when the UI updates, like counters, text fields, or API data.

# 2. How Flutter Uses the Widget Tree

Flutter builds everything as a widget tree.

Each widget is a small part of the UI.

When something changes (like a button press), Flutter rebuilds only the affected widgets.

This makes the UI fast and reactive.

# 3. Why Dart Is Ideal for Flutter

Dart compiles fast and gives smooth performance.

Supports hot reload, so changes appear instantly.

Works well for both UI and logic, making development simple.

# 4. Demo App Notes (Android / iOS)

Our demo app showed a simple screen with text and a button.

Pressing the button updated the counter (StatefulWidget).

### Firebase & Firestore Basics (Concept 2)

**1. Steps Followed for Firebase Setup**

Created a new project in Firebase Console.

Enabled Firestore Database.

Added Firebase to the Flutter app using the setup instructions.

Downloaded the google-services.json (Android) / GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS).

Added required Firebase dependencies in pubspec.yaml.

Initialized Firebase in the app using Firebase.initializeApp().

**2.How Firestore’s Real-Time Sync Works**

Firestore sends updates to the app instantly whenever data changes.

The app listens to the database using streams (like StreamBuilder).

No need to refresh—the UI updates automatically when Firestore data changes.

This works because Firestore uses real-time listeners under the hood.

**4. Reflection – How Firebase Simplified Backend Management**

No need to build your own server or database.

Firestore handled real-time data, storage, and syncing for us.

Authentication, hosting, and database all came ready to use.

This allowed us to focus more on UI and features instead of backend code.

Firebase helped build a working mobile app much faster and with less complexity.
