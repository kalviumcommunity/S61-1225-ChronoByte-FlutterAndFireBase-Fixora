## Flutter & Dart Basics (Concept 1)

# 1. StatelessWidget vs StatefulWidget

StatelessWidget:

Does not change once it is built.

Used for static UI like text, icons, simple layouts.

StatefulWidget:

Can change during the app’s lifetime.

Used when the UI updates, like counters, text fields, or API data.

# 2. How Flutter Uses the Widget Tree

Flutter builds everything as a widget tree.

Each widget is a small part of the UI.

When something changes (like a button press), Flutter rebuilds only the affected widgets.

This makes the UI fast and reactive.

# 3. Why Dart Is Ideal for Flutter

Dart compiles fast and gives smooth performance.

Supports hot reload, so changes appear instantly.

Works well for both UI and logic, making development simple.

# 4. Demo App Notes (Android / iOS)

Our demo app showed a simple screen with text and a button.

Pressing the button updated the counter (StatefulWidget).
